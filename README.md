# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My project was created on a 32 x 32 grid on code.org of an American Flag. I arranged the red and white stripes, the blue square on the top left with white squares in it representing the stars on the flag. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - I am proud that the flag is recognizable because it was a large grid to work on.
   - I am also proud that I completed the project on time because I had started with a harder idea of creating a Mario but it wasn't working like I had in mind. 

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - I originally wanted to code Mario on the grid, but for me it was really difficult. If I had more knowledge on how to fix and debug certain parts of the code, I would've been able to create it but I did not have enough knowledge for working on a 32x32 grid. In the future, after learning to code better, I could make something more detailed.
